# Domina: the game of checkers

**Domina is the classic checkers game!**

*Two players, each of whom control a twelve pawns dispersion, try to defeat the opponent by eating all of his pieces.
Men (pawns) that reach the end of the chessboard become kings (ladies) and they acquire superior power!*

*This application allows you to play against your computer, choosing between three levels of difficulty, or another person.*
